## Javascript game engine

Assemblage.js is a nascent javascript game engine. The name of the framework refers to the manner of its construction. The framework relies on

* jQuerry to do the ajax related things
* Underscore.js for "useful functional programming helpers"
* PIXI for graphics processing
* SAT.js for the collision detection
* Howler.js for the sound management

The goal of the engine is to provide the out of the box and easy to use functions that cover usual chores of game development.

Assemblage.js is the framework written with small development teams in mind. Nevertheless, with some additional work, it easily scales for the mid-range size projects.
