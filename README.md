# dodo.js
## Javascript game engine

Dodo.js is a nascent lightweight (< 500K) javascript game engine. The framework relies on

* Underscore.js for "useful functional programming helpers"
* PIXI for graphics processing
* SAT.js for the collision detection
* Howler.js for the sound management

The goal of the engine is to provide out of the box and easy to use functions that cover usual chores of game development.

Dodo.js is the framework written with small development teams in mind. Nevertheless, it can be easily scaled for mid-range size projects.
